**Database Management System Project README**

This README provides an in-depth overview of the "Database Management System" project, including its structure, classes, functionalities, and testing.

**Project Overview:**

The "Database Management System" project is designed to simulate a database management system capable of handling different types of databases, calculating their monthly costs, and generating reports. The project is implemented in Java and involves multiple classes organized into packages.

**Class Structure:**

1. **CentralizedDB:**
   - Represents a centralized database type.
   - Inherits from the `DB` class.
   - Contains instance variables for license cost.
   - Calculates monthly cost by adding base cost and license cost.
   - Provides a `toString` method for generating details about the object.

2. **DistributedDB:**
   - Represents a distributed database type.
   - Inherits from the `DB` class.
   - Contains instance variables for the number of users and cost per user.
   - Calculates user cost and monthly cost using a cost factor.
   - Provides a `toString` method for generating details about the object.

3. **HomogeneousDB:**
   - Represents a homogeneous database type.
   - Inherits from the `DistributedDB` class.
   - Uses a specific cost factor for calculating monthly cost.
   - Provides a `toString` method for generating details about the object.

4. **HeterogeneousDB:**
   - Represents a heterogeneous database type.
   - Inherits from the `DistributedDB` class.
   - Uses a different cost factor for calculating monthly cost.
   - Provides a `toString` method for generating details about the object.

5. **DB:**
   - Abstract class serving as the base for various database types.
   - Contains instance variables for name, base cost, and database storage.
   - Provides methods for getting and setting variables, calculating monthly cost, and generating details.

6. **InvalidCategoryException:**
   - Custom exception class for handling invalid category cases during file processing.

7. **MonthlyCostComparator:**
   - Comparator class for comparing `DB` objects based on their monthly costs.

8. **DBList:**
   - Class responsible for managing an array of `DB` objects and generating reports.
   - Contains methods for adding `DB` objects, reading from a file, generating various reports, and storing invalid records.

9. **DBPart3:**
   - Main class for running the project.
   - Reads a data file, processes database records, and generates reports.

**Functionality:**

1. Different database types (Centralized, Distributed, Homogeneous, Heterogeneous) are implemented as subclasses of the `DB` class, each with specific attributes and calculation methods.

2. The `DBList` class manages an array of `DB` objects and provides methods to add objects, read data from files, and generate reports.

3. Monthly cost calculations vary based on the database type and its attributes.

4. Exception handling is implemented to catch and manage errors during file processing.

5. JUnit test classes (`CentralizedDBTest`, `DistributedDBTest`, etc.) are provided to validate the functionality of each database type and their methods.

**Testing:**

JUnit test cases are designed to test various aspects of the project:
- Testing getter and setter methods for each database type.
- Testing calculation methods for monthly costs and user costs.
- Testing the `compareTo` method for comparing `DB` objects.
- Testing report generation methods for correctness.

**Conclusion:**

The "Database Management System" project demonstrates effective object-oriented programming principles and emphasizes the importance of inheritance, polymorphism, and proper exception handling. The project's classes are structured to handle different database types efficiently, and the JUnit test cases ensure the correctness of their functionalities. By reading from files, processing data, and generating detailed reports, the project simulates a simplified database management system.
